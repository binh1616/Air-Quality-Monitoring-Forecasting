# IoT-Based Urban Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting System

## Project Overview

This project implements an IoT-enabled system for real-time urban air quality monitoring and short-term forecasting using a distributed 5×5 grid of low-cost environmental sensors. The system combines hardware sensing (ESP32-based nodes), cloud storage (ThingSpeak), advanced spatio-temporal forecasting with a hybrid CNN–LSTM model, and an interactive web dashboard for visualization and alerts.

The primary goal is to provide accessible, high-resolution spatial and temporal air quality data to support public awareness, research, and decision-making in polluted urban areas (with a focus on cities like Hanoi, Vietnam).

### Key Features
- **Distributed Sensing Network**: 25 sensor nodes arranged in a 5×5 grid for spatial coverage.
- **Sensors**:
  - DHT11: Temperature and humidity
  - MQ-2: Combustible gases (e.g., LPG, smoke)
  - MQ-7: Carbon monoxide (CO)
  - GP2Y1010AU0F: PM2.5 particulate matter
- **Data Transmission**: ESP32 microcontrollers collect, calibrate, and upload data via Wi-Fi (HTTP/MQTT) to ThingSpeak.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Timestamp alignment, missing value interpolation, and feature scaling.
- **AI Forecasting**: Hybrid CNN–LSTM model for multi-variable, multi-sensor spatio-temporal prediction (3 past timesteps → next timestep).
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Heatmaps, time-series plots, historical filtering, prediction overlays, and alert indicators.
- **Performance**: Normalized RMSE ≈ 0.1043 (promising initial results).

## Motivation

Air pollution is a major public health crisis. In Vietnam:
- Ranked 22nd globally and 2nd in ASEAN (IQAir 2023)
- Hanoi frequently among the world's most polluted cities (PM2.5 ~6× WHO guideline)
- ~60,000–70,000 premature deaths annually
- Economic loss: $11–13 billion/year (~4–5% GDP)

This project aims to contribute affordable, scalable monitoring tools to support better urban air quality management.

## Components

### 1. IOT Layer (ESP32 Sensors)
- Hardware per node: ESP32, DHT11, MQ-2, MQ-7, GP2Y1010AU0F, resistors, breadboard, power supply
- Firmware: `IOT/sensor_data_with_mqtt.ino`
- Upload via Arduino IDE, configure Wi-Fi + ThingSpeak/MQTT credentials
- Deploy 25 nodes in 5×5 grid

### 2. Cloud Storage
- Create ThingSpeak channel with fields: Temperature, Humidity, CO, Gas, PM2.5 (+ optional Node ID/Grid position)
- Use Channel ID and Write API Key in ESP32 code

### 3. AI Forecasting Model
**Model Architecture (Hybrid CNN–LSTM):**

- Task: Multi-variable spatio-temporal forecasting on a 5×5 grid
- Input: (samples, 3 previous timesteps, 5, 5, 5 features) → predict the next timestep
- Main layers:
  - TimeDistributed Conv2D(32 filters, kernel 3×3, ReLU, padding same)
  - TimeDistributed MaxPooling2D(2×2)
  - TimeDistributed Flatten
  - LSTM(64 units, tanh)
  - Dropout(0.2)
  - Dense(125) → output for 25 nodes × 5 features
- All data is normalized to the [0,1] range
- Initial performance: RMSE ≈ 0.1043 (in normalized space)

### 4. Dashboard

🎯 Purpose  
Build a real-time dashboard to monitor sensor data from ThingSpeak, enabling users to:

- Track temperature, humidity, CO, combustible gases, PM2.5…
- Visualize data through metric cards, 5×5 grid heatmaps, and time-series charts
- Overlay AI model predictions
- Receive alerts when values exceed dangerous thresholds (color changes + notifications)

👉 Suitable for air quality monitoring systems, environmental IoT, labs, smart homes.

🛠 Technologies used

- React.js – Component-based dashboard interface
- JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic handling, API fetching, threshold-based coloring, sensor configuration
- CSS – Responsive design, dark mode, animations
- ThingSpeak REST API – Fetch real-time & historical data
- Chart library (Recharts / Chart.js) – Beautiful, interactive charts

In short: Modern React frontend dashboard + IoT data from ThingSpeak + smart visualization with alerts and forecasting overlays.

## Future Improvements
- Add advanced AI models (Transformer / GNN)
- Mobile application
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Public API
